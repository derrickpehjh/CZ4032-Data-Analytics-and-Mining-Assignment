## Scripts/Source Codes 
- The entire script can be found in this IPython notebook : https://github.com/derrickpehjh/CZ4032-Data-Analytics-and-Mining-Project/tree/master/codes
## Implementation Guidelines 
1. Installation of Python and Jupyter Notebook 
2. Download/Clone the entire github repository
3. In the command prompt, type the following command to open up the graphical interface on the browser:
python -m notebook 
  - Navigate to the folder of main.ipynb and open the file  
  - Ensure you have installed all the python packages as stated in the first few lines of the file   
  - Run the entire program  

  Alternatively for ease of access, we have also prepared an offline copy of the entire script named: main.html. It includes a pre-generated version of the data visualisation that is produced by the script.
